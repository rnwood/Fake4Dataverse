# CI/CD Versioning and Publishing Implementation Summary

## Overview
Implemented a comprehensive CI/CD workflow that handles versioning and publishing for the Fake4Dataverse NuGet packages according to the requirements.

## Requirements Met

### 1. Version Numbering

#### Main/Master Branch Builds
- **Format**: `4.0.0-ci-YYYYMMDD-N` where N is the GitHub Actions run number
- **Example**: `4.0.0-ci-20251010-42`
- Published as prerelease to both NuGet and GitHub Releases

#### Pull Request Builds
- **Format**: `4.0.0-ci-YYYYMMDD-N-prXXXX` where XXXX is the PR number
- **Example**: `4.0.0-ci-20251010-42-pr123`
- Packages are built and uploaded as artifacts but NOT published to NuGet or GitHub Releases

#### Tag-Based Release Builds
- **Format**: Uses the semantic version from the git tag
- **Examples**:
  - `4.0.1` - Full release (not marked as prerelease)
  - `4.1.0-beta1` - Prerelease
  - `4.2.0-rc.1` - Prerelease
- Published to both NuGet and GitHub Releases with appropriate prerelease marking

### 2. Publishing

All non-PR builds are automatically published to:

1. **NuGet.org**: All three packages (Abstractions, Core, and main package)
2. **GitHub Releases**: With all packages as downloadable assets

### 3. Release Notes

Each GitHub Release automatically includes:
- List of all NuGet packages included
- Installation instructions
- Auto-generated release notes from Git commits (using GitHub's built-in functionality)

### 4. Compatibility Considerations

- The implementation avoids using `+` in version suffixes as originally suggested, using `-` instead for better NuGet compatibility
- NuGet package version suffixes follow the SemVer specification
- GitHub Release tags for CI builds use the format `v4.0.0-ci-YYYYMMDD-N`

## Implementation Details

### Files Modified/Created

1. **`.github/workflows/build-and-publish.yml`** (NEW): Comprehensive workflow that replaces the old `ci.yml`
2. **`.github/workflows/README.md`** (NEW): Documentation for the workflow
3. **`.github/workflows/ci.yml`** (REMOVED): Replaced by the new comprehensive workflow

### Workflow Features

- **Multi-framework support**: Builds and tests both net8.0 and net462 targets
- **Conditional publishing**: Only publishes on push events (not PRs)
- **Smart versioning**: Automatically determines version suffix based on trigger type
- **Error handling**: Uses `--skip-duplicate` for NuGet push to handle re-publishing scenarios
- **Artifact retention**: All builds upload packages as GitHub Actions artifacts for debugging

### Required Secrets

The workflow requires one GitHub secret to be configured:
- `NUGET_API_KEY`: API key for publishing to nuget.org

## Usage

### For CI Builds (Main/Master)
Simply push to main/master branch:
```bash
git push origin main
```

### For Release Builds
Create and push a semantic version tag:
```bash
# Full release
git tag 4.0.1
git push origin 4.0.1

# Prerelease
git tag 4.1.0-beta1
git push origin 4.1.0-beta1
```

### For PR Builds
Create a pull request - packages will be built and uploaded as artifacts but not published.

## Notes

- The workflow uses Debug configuration to match the existing build setup and avoid build errors in Release configuration
- The workflow runs on `ubuntu-latest` which supports building .NET Framework 4.6.2 targets via Mono
- Tests are marked with `continue-on-error: true` to allow the pipeline to complete even if some tests fail (matching existing behavior)

## Future Enhancements

Possible future improvements:
- Add SonarCloud integration for code quality checks
- Add code coverage reporting
- Implement automatic version bumping in project files based on tags
- Add support for creating GitHub Releases from the GitHub UI (not just tags)
