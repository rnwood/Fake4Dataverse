## How to Use

### Option 1: Automated Creation (Recommended)

```bash
# Preview what will be created (no changes made)
./create-feature-parity-issues.sh --dry-run

# Create all 30 issues in GitHub
./create-feature-parity-issues.sh
```

**Requirements:**
- GitHub CLI (`gh`) installed and authenticated
- Write access to the repository

### Option 2: Manual Creation

1. Open `FEATURE_PARITY_ISSUES.md`
2. Find the issue you want to create
3. Copy the title and description
4. Create a new GitHub issue with the provided information
5. Add the suggested labels

### Option 3: Selective Creation

Edit `create-feature-parity-issues.sh` and comment out issues you don't want to create, then run the script.

## Issue Labeling System

Each issue is automatically labeled with:

- **Priority**: `high-priority`, `medium-priority`, `low-priority`
- **Type**: `enhancement` (all issues)
- **Category**: One or more of:
  - `message-executor` - New message executors
  - `query-support` - Query operator enhancements
  - `plugins` - Plugin execution improvements
  - `field-types` - Special field types
  - `business-logic` - Business rules and validation
  - `metadata` - Metadata operations
  - `security` - Security and permissions
  - `testing` - Testing infrastructure
  - `audit` - Audit logging
  - `data-quality` - Data quality features
  - `async` - Async/await support
  - `modern-dataverse` - Modern Dataverse features
  - `power-platform` - Power Platform integration
  - `power-automate` - Power Automate features
  - `virtual-entities` - Virtual entity support
  - `elastic-tables` - Elastic table support

## Next Steps After Creating Issues

1. **Create a Project Board**
   - Organize issues by priority and status
   - Track progress visually

2. **Prioritize Based on Community Needs**
   - High priority issues are suggestions
   - Adjust based on actual usage patterns

3. **Link Related Issues**
   - Some features depend on others
   - Create dependency relationships

4. **Start Contributing**
   - Pick an issue
   - Comment to claim it
   - Implement and submit PR

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Core Functionality (High Priority)
Focus on issues 1-10 first. These provide the most value to the most users.

**Estimated Impact**: Covers ~70% of common testing scenarios

### Phase 2: Enhanced Testing (Medium Priority)
Address issues based on community feedback and usage patterns.

**Estimated Impact**: Brings coverage to ~90% of testing scenarios

### Phase 3: Advanced Features (Low Priority)
Implement based on specific use cases and community contributions.

**Estimated Impact**: Enables specialized and advanced scenarios
