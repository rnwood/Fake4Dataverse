# Fake4Dataverse: Test Automation Framework for Microsoft Dataverse and Power Platform

## About This Project

Fake4Dataverse is a fork of the FakeXrmEasy project, originally created by Jordi Montaña. This fork continues the development of the testing framework under the MIT License, based on the last version of FakeXrmEasy that was available under that license.

**Author:** Rob Wood  
**Original Author:** Jordi Montaña (@jordimontana)  
**License:** MIT (see LICENSE.txt files in each project folder)

### Fork Basis

This fork is based on an early development version of FakeXrmEasy v2, which was released under the MIT License. The original FakeXrmEasy project subsequently changed its licensing model. This fork preserves the last MIT-licensed version to ensure continued open-source availability for the community.

**Original Repositories:**
- Core: https://github.com/DynamicsValue/fake-xrm-easy-core
- Abstractions: https://github.com/DynamicsValue/fake-xrm-easy-abstractions
- Legacy: https://github.com/jordimontana82/fake-xrm-easy

The original repositories were licensed under MIT at the time this fork was created, as evidenced by the LICENSE files in those repositories in the commit we forked from (the history is preserved in this repo).

## Why This Fork?

The original Fake4Dataverse project was an invaluable tool for the Dynamics 365 / Dataverse community, providing a comprehensive testing framework that enabled developers to write unit tests without requiring a live CRM instance. However, the original project moved to a commercial licensing model after version 2.x.

This fork serves several purposes:

1. **Preserve Open Source Access**: By forking from the last MIT-licensed version, we ensure that the community continues to have access to a free, open-source testing framework for Dataverse development.

2. **Community-Driven Development**: This fork is maintained by the community, for the community. We welcome contributions and aim to keep the project aligned with community needs.

3. **Modern Platform Support**: While respecting the original codebase, we aim to update and maintain compatibility with modern versions of Dataverse, Power Platform, and .NET.

4. **Legal Clarity**: This fork is completely legal and in accordance with the MIT License under which the original FakeXrmEasy was released. The MIT License explicitly permits forking, modification, and redistribution of the code.

## Is Forking from the Last MIT Version Legal?

**Absolutely yes.** The MIT License is one of the most permissive open-source licenses and explicitly grants the rights to:
- Use the software for any purpose
- Make copies and distribute them
- Modify the source code
- Distribute modified versions

The original FakeXrmEasy was released under the MIT License, which means that version and all prior versions remain available under that license permanently. The license cannot be retroactively revoked. When Jordi Montaña chose to change the licensing model for future versions, previous MIT-licensed versions remained under the MIT License.

This fork:
- Is based on an early version 2.x, which was released under the MIT License
- Properly acknowledges the original author (Jordi Montaña) in all LICENSE files
- Maintains all original copyright notices as required by the MIT License
- Continues to use the MIT License for all derivatives

## Acknowledgments

We are deeply grateful to **Jordi Montaña** for creating FakeXrmEasy and releasing it under the MIT License. His work has been instrumental to thousands of developers in the Dynamics 365 and Power Platform community. Please consider supporting his commercial and original version.

### Key Gaps in Fake4Dataverse (This Fork)

Based on this analysis, Fake4Dataverse is missing several features compared to the commercial FakeXrmEasy v2+:

#### High-Priority Missing Features:
1. **Workflow/Custom Workflow Activities** - Removed due to SDK limitations
2. **Custom Actions** - Limited support for custom actions
3. **Calculated/Rollup Fields** - No simulation of calculated or rollup fields
4. **Business Rules** - No business rule simulation
5. **Duplicate Detection** - No duplicate detection simulation
6. **Audit Log** - No audit log simulation

#### Modern Dataverse Features Not Supported:
7. **Virtual Entities** - No virtual entity support
8. **Elastic Tables** - No elastic table support
9. **Cloud Flows Integration** - No cloud flow simulation
10. **Power Automate Testing** - No Power Automate integration testing
11. **Connection References** - No connection reference support
12. **Advanced Security Model** - Limited security role and privilege simulation
13. **Concurrent Execution Testing** - No multi-threaded execution testing
14. **Performance Profiling** - No built-in profiling tools

#### Pipeline & Plugin Limitations:
15. **Async Plugin Support** - Limited async plugin testing
16. **Complete Pre/Post Image Support** - Basic implementation only

#### Metadata Limitations:
23. **Global OptionSets** - Partial support only
24. **Publisher Metadata** - Not supported
25. **Solution Metadata** - Not supported
26. **Complete Metadata Operations** - Many RetrieveMetadata variants missing

#### Additional Missing Message Executors (estimated 50+ messages):
27. Various business-specific messages (Marketing, Service, Field Service specific)
28. Advanced relationship messages
29. Modern Dataverse-specific messages
30. And many more organization requests added in recent Dynamics 365 versions

This honest assessment shows that while Fake4Dataverse provides a solid foundation with 47 message executors and core testing capabilities, it represents an early v2 development snapshot and lacks the maturity and feature completeness of the actively developed commercial FakeXrmEasy v2+. The commercial version has continued to add significant features, especially around modern Dataverse capabilities, advanced pipeline simulation, and quality-of-life improvements that benefit from ongoing commercial development and support.
